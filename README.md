In a Data Science solution for credit scoring problem using the CRISP-DM framework, the following steps are followed: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. In the business understanding phase, the business objectives and requirements are identified. Data relevant to credit scoring is collected and explored in the data understanding phase. Data is then prepared through cleaning and transformation. In the modeling phase, a credit scoring model is built using various Machine Learning algorithms. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated by testing it on unseen data.
